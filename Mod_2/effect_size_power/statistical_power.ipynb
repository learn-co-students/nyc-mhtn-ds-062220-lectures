    "Consider some particular null hypothesis to the effect that Hepomanol, an experimental drug, has no effect in the treatment of liver cancer. And suppose in fact that this hypothesis is false. A typical test for the effectiveness of Hepomanol would involve patients with liver cancer taking both Hepomanol and a placebo. Some patients would show amelioration of symptoms and others would not. Given that the null hypothesis is false, we ought to expect to see a correlation between those who took Hepomanol and those who experienced relief of symptoms. But the probability that we might, by random chance, see _no_ correlation is higher for smaller sample sizes. The more patients we test, the more likely we are to observe the actually existing correlation. Thus, all else equal, tests involving larger samples will have higher degrees of power.\n",
