    "- **min_child_weight [default=1]**\n",
    "    - Defines the minimum sum of weights of all observations required in a child.\n",
    "    - This is similar to min_child_leaf in GBM but not exactly. This refers to min “sum of weights” of observations while GBM has min “number of observations”.\n",
    "    - Used to control over-fitting. Higher values prevent a model from learning relations which might be highly specific to the particular sample selected for a tree.\n",
    "    - Too high values can lead to under-fitting hence, it should be tuned using CV.\n",
    "- **max_depth [default=6]**\n",
    "    - The maximum depth of a tree, same as GBM.\n",

    "    - If this is defined, GBM will ignore max_depth.\n",
    "- **gamma [default=0]**\n",
    "    - A node is split only when the resulting split gives a positive reduction in the loss function. Gamma specifies the minimum loss reduction required to make a split.\n",
    "    - Makes the algorithm conservative. The values can vary depending on the loss function and should be tuned.\n",
    "- **max_delta_step [default=0]**\n",
    "    - In maximum delta step we allow each tree’s weight estimation to be. If the value is set to 0, it means there is no constraint. If it is set to a positive value, it can help making the update step more conservative.\n",

    "    - This is generally not used but you can explore further if you wish.\n",
    "- **subsample [default=1]**\n",
    "    - Same as the subsample of GBM. Denotes the fraction of observations to be randomly samples for each tree.\n",

    "    - This used to handle the regularization part of XGBoost. Though many data scientists don’t use it often, it should be explored to reduce overfitting.\n",
